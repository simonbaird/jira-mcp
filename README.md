# redhat-ai-tools/jira-mcp

A containerized Python MCP server for Cursor to provide access to Jira.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is experimental and was initially created as a learning exercise.
> Be aware there are more capable and mature Jira MCP solutions available,
> such as [sooperset/mcp-atlassian](https://github.com/sooperset/mcp-atlassian),
> and Atlassian's own [MCP Server](https://www.atlassian.com/platform/remote-mcp-server).

See also [redhat-ai-tools/jira-mcp-snowflake](https://github.com/redhat-ai-tools/jira-mcp-snowflake)
which provides another way to access Red Hat Jira data.

## Prerequisites

- **podman** - Install with `sudo dnf install podman` (Fedora/RHEL) or `brew install podman` (macOS)
- **make** - Usually pre-installed on most systems

## Quick Start

1. **Get the code**
  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:redhat-ai-tools/jira-mcp.git
  cd jira-mcp
  ```
2. **Build the image & configure Cursor**<br>
  This also creates a `~/.rh-jira-mcp.env` file like [this](example.env).
  ```bash
  make setup
  ```

3. **Prepare a Jira token**
   * Go to [Red Hat Jira Personal Access Tokens](https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?selectedTab=com.atlassian.pats.pats-plugin:jira-user-personal-access-tokens) and create a token
   * Edit the `.rh-jira-mcp.env` file in your home directory and paste in the token

To confirm it's working, run Cursor, go to Settings and click on "Tools &
Integrations". Under MCP Tools you should see "jiraMcp" with 20 tools enabled.
